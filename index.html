          <h2>Mother Teresa</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mother Teresa</b>, originally named<b> Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu</b>,
            was born on <b>August 26, 1910</b>, in <b>Skopje, Macedonia</b>.
            From a young age, she felt a deep calling to help others, leading
            her to join the Sisters of Loreto at 18. She was sent to India,
            where she spent years teaching before experiencing a
            <b>"call within a call"</b> to serve the poorest of the poor. In
            1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta, an order
            dedicated to caring for those society had forgotten: the sick, the
            orphaned, and the dying. Her work spread across the globe,
            establishing homes for the destitute and sick in over 130 countries.
            Mother Teresa's life was a testament to selfless service and
            unwavering faith,
            <b>earning her the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 </b>and global
            admiration. Despite facing criticism, her dedication to humanity's
            most vulnerable never wavered. She passed away on
            <b>September 5, 1997</b>, and was canonized as Saint Teresa of
            Calcutta in 2016, continuing to inspire countless individuals with
            her message of love, compassion, and humility.
